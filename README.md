Nerox Music is a feature-rich, privacy-focused YouTube Music client built with Flutter, offering a premium ad-free experience with background playback, offline downloads, synchronized & karaoke lyrics, a modern Liquid Glass UI, smart background caching, Spotify playlist imports, a sleep timer, and community sharing — with or without an account.

---

## ✨ Key Features

### 🎨 Liquid Glass UI/UX
- **Dynamic Glassmorphic Themes** — Premium styling in both Dark and Light modes using the dynamic `liquid_glass_easy` package. Light Mode features a semi-transparent white tint that adapts dynamically to the album art.
- **Custom Shaders & Blur** — High-performance frosted glass panels, overlays, and custom shaders that adapt smoothly to artwork colors.
- **Contrast-Aware Elements** — Status bar icons, player controls, progress sliders, borders, and menus automatically invert colors based on the active theme for perfect legibility.
- **Big Screen & Desktop Optimization** — Responsive player layouts with max-width constraints (up to 1300px), centered dialogs, and a dedicated top search bar and profile dropdown for larger screens.
- **Sleek iOS-Inspired Forms** — Pill-shaped inputs and circular badges throughout upload/edit menus and notifications.

### 🎧 Immersive Audio & Synced Lyrics
- **Smooth Word-by-Word Karaoke** — Words fill up with color gradually in real time as the artist sings, running at a buttery-smooth 60+ FPS.
- **Line-by-Line Synced Sweep** — A progressive sweep effect colors repeated lines sequentially.
- **Active Line Highlight & Scrolling** — The active line slides slightly right and lights up; scrolling glides smoothly rather than jumping.
- **Lofi Mode** — Turn any track into a Lofi vibe with slowed speed (0.9×), pitch correction, and native reverb.
- **Multi-Language Audio & Quality Control** — Detects and switches between available languages and streams in High, Medium, or Low quality.
- **Background Playback & Native Effects** — Music keeps playing with the screen off, using platform-specific audio effects.

### ⚡ Smart Cache System
- **Asynchronous Background Caching** — Automatically caches new tracks in the background when added to playlists, favorites, or the library.
- **Multi-Resolution Artwork Caching** — Downloads and saves both high- and low-res thumbnails locally for instant visual feedback.
- **Instant Zero-Wait Playback** — Bypasses network request time entirely for cached tracks.
- **Bandwidth-Aware Checks** — Skips download queues for already-cached tracks to save battery and data.

### 📚 Discovery, Import & Community
- **Spotify Playlist Import** — Paste any public Spotify playlist URL to instantly import your tracks.
- **Community Feed & Sharing** — Search, stream, and discover tracks uploaded by the community.
- **Artist Following** — Follow favorite artists and channels directly from their profile pages.
- **Smart Queue & Infinite Playback** — Queue clearing empties upcoming songs in auto-queue mode; the clear button disables when only the active song remains.
- **Offline Downloads** — Download songs and videos for offline listening.
- **Recently Played Grid** — Compact 2-column grid of recently played tracks on the home screen.
- **Custom Canvas Video Backgrounds** — Support for custom MP4 canvas backgrounds with a dedicated uploader dashboard.

### 🔒 Privacy & Accounts
- **Optional Accounts & Cloud Sync** — Sign in with Google to upload your own tracks and view your Apple-style Profile Card.
- **Privacy First** — No login required; favorites, playlists, and history are stored locally by default.
- **Zero-Wait Launch** — Parallel background loading for instant app startup.
- **Ad-Free & Reliable** — RapidAPI and Metadata API Relay fallback (with Hugging Face bucket caching) guarantee playback.
- **Share to Play** — Share links from YouTube or YouTube Music directly into Nerox Music.
- **Nerox Music Deep Linking (`muzo://`)** — The existing `muzo://` scheme remains supported for backward compatibility when opening songs (`muzo://s/<id>`), artists (`muzo://artist/<id>`), albums (`muzo://album/<id>`), and playlists (`muzo://playlist/<id>`).

## ⚙️ Setup & Installation

> ⚠️ Reminder: this repo is a frozen, outdated snapshot — known issues from this version have already been fixed, but only in the Play Store build. For the real, up-to-date, bug-fixed app, install from the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Shashwat.Muzo). The steps below are kept for historical/reference purposes only.

**Prerequisites:** Flutter SDK (latest stable), Dart SDK, Android Studio / VS Code, Java JDK 17

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Shashwat-CODING/Muzo.git
cd Muzo

# Install dependencies
flutter pub get

# Run the app
flutter run

# Build release APK (split by ABI for smaller size)
flutter build apk --split-per-abi
```

### GitHub release automation

The workflow at [`.github/workflows/release.yml`](.github/workflows/release.yml)
builds and attaches the following artifacts to a GitHub Release:

- **Windows:** `Nerox-Music-Setup.exe` installer
- **Android:** split APKs and an App Bundle
- **iOS:** an unsigned `Runner.xcarchive` archive

Create and push a version tag to run it automatically:

```bash
git tag v3.9.0
git push origin v3.9.0
```

The iOS archive is intentionally built with `--no-codesign`, so Apple signing
certificates are not stored in GitHub Actions. It must be signed before device
installation or App Store Connect upload.

Android release signing uses four GitHub repository secrets:

- `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_BASE64`
- `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`
- `ANDROID_KEY_ALIAS`
- `ANDROID_KEY_PASSWORD`

The release workflow restores the same keystore on every run, so Android
updates keep a stable signing identity. The keystore and `android/key.properties`
are ignored and must never be committed. Local builds without those files
continue to use the debug signing key.

## 🙏 Acknowledgements

Nerox Music wouldn't exist without the incredible work of these developers and projects:

### YouTube Extraction
Huge thanks to **[Hexer10](https://github.com/Hexer10)**, original author of [youtube_explode_dart](https://github.com/Hexer10/youtube_explode_dart) — the backbone of Nerox Music's YouTube streaming and metadata extraction — and to **[anandnet](https://github.com/anandnet)** for maintaining an up-to-date fork.

### Animesh (n-ce) — fast-saavn & ytify
An enormous shoutout to **[Animesh (n-ce)](https://github.com/n-ce)**, creator of:
- **[fast-saavn](https://github.com/n-ce/saavn)** — the blazing-fast, open JioSaavn API powering Nerox Music's music metadata, song details, and search.
- **[ytify](https://github.com/n-ce/ytify)** — a beautifully minimal YouTube audio streaming web app that was a huge source of inspiration for Nerox Music's UI/UX and audio handling.
